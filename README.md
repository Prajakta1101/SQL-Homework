# SQL-Homework
Study of employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. There are six datafiles to review. Before analyzing the data using SQL, I have taken 2 steps of Data modeling & Data engineering and then analyzed the data using SQL. 

Data Modeling: It includes inspecting the CSVs and sketch out an ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram i.e shapshot of data structures) of the tables.

Data Engineering: To import CSV files into SQL server, first created schema for each of six CSV files, specifying the Data types, primery keys, foreign keys etc. 

Data Analysis: Basis the following given points I have analyzed the data
  - List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, gender, and salary.
  - List employees who were hired in 1986.
  - List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name, and start and end     employment dates.
  - List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
  - List all employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."
  - List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
  - List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
  - In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.
